# MuseumOfCandy
The webpage was developed with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 4
- Javascript (very little)

It has the following features:
- Fancy design
- Very responsive (looks good in any size)
- The website is currently not functional because the purpose of this is just to practice html and css strategies that I learned so far.

Note:
This is a practice assignment done along with the course The Web Developer Bootcamp taught by Colt Steele on Udemy
